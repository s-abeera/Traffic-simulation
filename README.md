<b><i>A cellular automata model of traffic </i></b>

A cellular automata model using the Intelligent Driver Model (IBM) updating rules with the
implementation of static and dynamic (vehicle density-based signals) traffic signals

A static traffic signal has a fixed signal cycle after which the light changes, while a dynamic signal strategy optimises traffic flow by changing the signal of the
road pair that has more car density compared to the other. The dynamic signal strategy was shown to significantly decrease road density and increase average traffic flow
as compared to a static signal model.
